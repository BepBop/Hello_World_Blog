    <h1> Intro </h1>
    <h2> Hello World</h2>
    <p>I am in my Senior Year now, pursuing CSE. This is my monthly r&#233sum&#233.</p>
    <p>I have been working on introducing myself to world of JavaScript via React Web framework and of course pushing
        this HTML/CSS/Bootstrap page out, but sadly, thinking of dropping JS in favour of learning my
        first procedural programming language C</p>
    <div class="date">July 2019</div>
    <p>Finally, well I am at intermediate level in C. And, I ‚ù§ C. Its such a lovely language. Now am finally picking JS
        & NodeJS back up where I left.</p>
    <div class="date">Sept 2019</div>
    <p>First semester has been really hard on me, I didn't know where to study from for college exams.</p>
    <div class="date">Oct 2019</div>
    <p>I could only learn HTML/CSS, some JS outside my course</p>
    <div class="date end"> End Of Semester</div>

    <p>College. Where to start, so much to learn and so little time. It has been fun building so many projects. I aimed
        for React and JS but sadly couldn't find enough energy to give, but I will say I am fairly competent at Bash
        now!</p>
    <div class="date">Jan 2020</div>
    <p>C++, It's a new and rough experience because of these utterly new OOP concepts! But I think I am halfway done
        understanding them.</p>
    <div class="date">March 2020</div>
    <p> I am building HTML/CSS/JS called Urban Sports Club project for my Internet Lab Class! And an OOP/fstream project
        called, CLI ATM</p>
    <div class="date">May 2020</div>
    <p>Lockdown has started that means I won't get to attend my JS and C++ courses further.</p>
    <p>Online Exams went well, thankfully</p>
    <div class="date end">End Of Semester</div>
